# Neovim App Interface

This project was created to open files from finder using neovim instead of text-edit or another text editor

## Build
### Dependancies
This project was made with the intention of using tmux as a session manager.
Please have tmux and neovim on your terminal path

## Build Process
paste the code into an Automator program and it should just work

side-note if you arn't using Iterm change the program from Iterm to whichever terminal you like to use
